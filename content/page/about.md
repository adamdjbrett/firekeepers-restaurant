### About

Firekeepers was acquired by the Onondaga Nation in 2014. 
For two years renovations were made, adding more dining room and making further updates to revitalize the well-known establishment. 
Their hard work and dedication is not limited only to their dining clientelle, but also reaches outward into the community. 
Revenue from Firekeepers has been used by the Onondaga Nation to fund initiatives such as caretaking for elders, building homes, and a youth summer program. 
Manager Theresa Homer feels her role is greater than just serving food, and takes great pride in what Firekeepers has accomplished.
They look forward to serving you now, and in the future!
